### What is Docker?
Docker is an engine that allows you to run containers. Containers have many advantages including the following:

- Code and dependancies are packaged together allowing the software to run more reliably across varying environments
- Standard unit of software
- Standalone executable package including everything needed to run the application
- Lightweight in comparison to virtual machines

**Docker vs Virtual Machines**

| Container                                                       | Virtual Machine                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application layer abstraction                                   | Physical layer abstraction                                                               |
| Consume less space than VMs                                     | Include a full copy of the operating system                                              |
| Fast to startup                                                 | Boot up slowly                                                                           |
| Shared OS kernel allows many containers to run on a single host | Multiple virtual machines run on one server at a greater resource cost per guest machine |

**Dockerfile vs Image vs Container**
I think it's very important to explain the difference between these three concepts before we move forward with our workflow file.

| Dockerfile                                                                                      | Docker Image                                                                                                                                                         | Docker Container                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Text document that contains all the commands and instructions necessary to build a Docker Image | Executable packages comprised of code, dependancies, libraries, a runtime, environment variable and configuration files.  Very similar to a virtual machine snapshot | A runtime instance of a Docker Image.  This is what the image becomes when it is executed in memory. |

**What About Our Workflow?**

Our repository contains a `Dockerfile`, source code and tests for the Tic Tac Toe application.

Our CI Workflow allows us to make code changes and those changes will trigger an automated build and automated tests, but it doesn't go any further than that.  It doesn't produce us with a deployable artifact.

So we are going to place our application into a Docker container so that we have a deployable package.  This task is what allows us to move from CI to CD.

Because a `Dockerfile` is a text file we are able to place it right alongside our source code allowing us a single point of truth for our application.

As you learned above, we need turn that `Dockerfile` into a `Docker Image` if we want a runtime instance of it at some point, and we are going to store that image in the `GitHub Package Registry`.
