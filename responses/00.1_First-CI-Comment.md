**Step 1:**

1. Click the `Actions` tab in your repository (**you may want to keep these instructions available as you do so!**)

The steps above will bring you to the workflow editor.  It is here that we outline the instructions for our event triggers, the GitHub Actions that will be consumed and all the other [pieces](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) that go into a successful workflow file.
