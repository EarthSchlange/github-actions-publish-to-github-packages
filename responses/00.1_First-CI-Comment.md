## Getting Our Workflow to the Correct Place

I have added a file on this branch called `ci-workflow.yml` but now I need your help!

As a ü§ñI can only do so many things, and setting up a workflow for you isn't on my list.  Don't worry, I'll be here to help you, just follow these steps and we should be üëç

All we are going to do is move the file I have ‚úçÔ∏èfor you into a new folder

- [edit]({{repoUrl}}/edit/ci-workflow/.github/ci-workflow.yml) the files location by changing it's path from this:

- To this (yes, I just need you to change the folder which this file lives in!):

- Commit the file to the `ci-workflow` branch once you have changed the path:
