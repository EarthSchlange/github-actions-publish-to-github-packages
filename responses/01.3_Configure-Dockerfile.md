## Dockerfile üê≥

If you remember the `Dockerfile` contains a set of instructions that get stored in our a `Docker Image`.

For the sake of our workshop we will use a very simple `Dockerfile` but if you can [learn more](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) about what a `Dockerfile` is capable of if this interests you.

**Steps:**

1. Create a new file in the root of this repo named `Dockerfile` ... it's case-sensitive by the way!

2. Place the following contents inside of the Docker file
    ```dockerfile
   FROM nginx:1.17
   COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
    ```
3. Commit the file to this repository!
