# Setup CI Workflow

### What is CI?

Take a second to examine the image below as it shows the relationship between **continuous integration**, **continuous delivery** and **continuous deployment**.

**Continuous integration** (CI) is a practice where developers are required to integrate code into a shared branch, often referred to as **trunk**, multiple times per day.  With each code check-in a series of automated events begin to take place. 

1. Source code goes through an automated build process if necessary
2. Automated testing of the software takes place
3. Reports are generated and sent back to the developers with the status of their changes

**GOAL:** Regular code integration allows developers the ability to detect and locate errors quicker and easier than before.

### Why do we need this?

Since **continuous delivery** (CD) is the natural "next phase" of **continuous integration** (CI) setting up a CI workflow will help us see the entire picture of what our workflow is doing.

With that stated, this is definitely **NOT** a course on CI, so we will not being going into detail on what that means or how to get it up and running with GitHub Actions.

Wait!  There's good news üëç! If you need a CI refresher you can take the [Using GitHub Actions for CI]() Learning Lab course to get up to speed on these topics quickly.
