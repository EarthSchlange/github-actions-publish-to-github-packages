## Let's Edit Our Workflow File

We are going to [edit]({{workflowUrl}}) the current workflow file in our repository by adding adding a job that turns our `Dockerfile` into a `Docker Image`.

**Steps:**
1. Rename `ci-workflow.yml` to `docker-workflow.yml`

2. Add the following job to your workflow file

```yaml

  Build-and-Push-Docker-Image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Docker Build, Tag, Push
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Download built artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@master
        with:
          name: webpack artifacts
          path: public

      - name: Build, Tag, Push
        uses: mattdavis0351/actions/docker-gpr@v1
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          image-name: tic-tac-toe
```
